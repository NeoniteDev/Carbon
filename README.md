<!-- ABOUT NEONITEV2 -->
## About Carbon

Carbon is a launcher written in C++ for the NeoniteV2 private server. It is an easy to use launcher with Cranium(Neonite++ in-game) support.  _If you are an Epic Games employee and have any problems with this project, please do not hesitate to [contact us](#contact) through your official business email._ <br>
_In acquiescence to Epic Games Inc. - Please note that access to all cosmetics for Neonite V2 has been stripped. If you want to use skins, please purchase them on Fortnite._

<!-- FAQs -->
## FAQs

 * How do I access the Neonite dashboard?
   * You can access Neonite V2's dashboard at http://localhost:5595/.
 * Can I go in-game?
   * Yes, press `f3` in the lobby to go in-game.
 * Will I get banned?
   * No, you won't get banned because Neonite and Carbon don't connect to any Epic Games related services.
 * How do I play with my friends?
   * Neonite V2 is a locally-hosted project, meaning it has no party or friends functionality.
 * Why don't I see any cosmetics in my locker?
   * We removed cosmetics because Epic Games made it clear it does not like services that offer cosmetics for free. If you wish for skins you're welcome to add them yourself.
